                Back on My Feet, a national organization operating in 12 major cities coast to coast, combats homelessness through the power of running, community support and essential employment and housing resources.</p>

				<h2>Our Program</h2>
						<div class="col-sm-12 img">

				        </div>
				<p class="text">Back on My Feet members are individuals currently experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless. To join the program, members must be referred by one of our facility or referral partners. Members range in age from 18 to over 65. 35% of our members are veterans. 53% are African American, 31% Caucasian and 14% Hispanic. Some members have a college education, while others are working on their GED. Most of our members have families – over 60% have children – and we watch, time and time again, as Back on My Feet reunites them around something positive.</br>

                Back on My Feet looks beyond backgrounds and focuses on our shared human experiences—the innate desire to feel recognized and supported, the need for goals and a way to accomplish them. No matter our circumstances, Back on My Feet shows that something as seemingly simple as running can strengthen individuals, build communities and transform lives.

				<p class="text">Back on My Feet recruits members at homeless and residential facilities around the country and begins with a commitment to run three days a week in the early morning. After 30 days in the program, members with 90% attendance earn the opportunity to move into the second phase of the program called Next Steps, which provides educational support, job training programs, employment partnership referrals and housing resources. Over 80% of individuals who start our program move into the Next Steps phase.</br>

                In Next Steps, members work with BoMF program staff to develop a personal road map to independence. Each member attends financial literacy classes and job skills training provided through partnerships with our corporate partners. Members can earn financial assistance to remove barriers to employment and housing such as work supplies, transportation and security deposits. Members who achieve employment and housing become Alumni Members. Within six months of becoming a Back on My Feet Alumnus, 90% of members maintain their employment, 60% receive a wage increase and 20% achieve a promotion.</p><br>
